				"A nomad (Greek: nomas, plural nomades; meaning one roaming about for pasture, pastoral tribe) is a member of a community of people who live in different locations, moving from one place to another."
				<p>That is who I am am, this what my family does. I do not rely on Wikipedia for precise definitions, but in this case it is quite accurate. 
				</p>
				<p>Being always on the go and ready for a change, I have been looking for a brand new challenge for quite some time. The Rutgers Bootcamp seems to be it.

			<h3>Roots and branches</h3>
				<p> I come from Southeast Europe. From Macedonia. I've travelled a little bit in Europe... Germany, Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, and Serbia. Just a tiny bit in the US... Florida, Texas, Kansas.. Couple road trips from Oklahoma to New Jersey... 
				</p>
				<p>Some of my best friends are also nomads. They roam in Spain, Sweden, Macedonia, the Netherlands, and the UK. Some in Oklahoma, Texas, California, Kentucky, and Kansas. I wish we could see each other more often. But life gets busy and there are so many excuses. But I deeply believe that we deeply love each other and miss each other.
				</p>
				<p>Living in Oklahoma from 2007-2014 was quite the experience. Met people that I will miss forever. Mentors, friends, colleagues. Living in Princeton, NJ is similar to living in Skopje, Macedonia. Close to both ocean and mauntain; half-way between New York City and Philadelphia. Marked by the many crossroads... Skopje - my birth place, has been known as an important route from Europe to the Middle East; an ultimate crossroad of people and trades. But unlike Princeton, I am completely biased to Skopje. The city that I carry in my heart; the place that I don't visit nearly as much as I want to or as much as my soul yearns.
